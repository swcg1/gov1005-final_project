#### About the Topic
As an emerging product and UI/UX designer coming from an unconventional design
background, I have recently been interested in taking a deeper dive into better
understanding what the design field quantitatively looks like. I am particularly
interested in learning more about what the demographic of current designers are,
how its have changed over the last two years, and how it correlates with the
general spread of companies and industries in the US.

This project aims to hopefully elucidate design career trends for anyone
interested in entering the field, already in the field, or curious about design.

#### About the Data
The Design Census data was collected by The American Institute of Graphic Arts
(AIGA) most recently in 2017 and 2019. The Design Census was a survey that was
circulated in the design community and open to public for 5 weeks. The raw csv
data files were downloaded from the respective Design Census websites, which can
be found [here for the 2019 data](https://designcensus.org/) and [here for the
2017 data](http://designcensus2017.aiga.org/).

The data set on US companies was from the Open Data 500 Project, which is the
first comprehensive study of US companies that use open government data
conducted by the GovLab of New York University. The raw csv data files were
downloaded from the Open Data 500 website, which can be found
[here](https://www.opendata500.com/us/).

In order to make sense of the zip codes from the aforementioned data sets, a US
zip codes data set from SimpleMaps was used to configure zip codes to states and
cities. The zip codes dataset can be found
[here](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips).

#### About Me
I am a senior concentrating in Neuroscience with a secondary in Mind, Brain, and
Behavior. I have a wide range of interests from life sciences to engineering to
design and would love to chat with anyone who's curious about any of the above
(or anyone who's curious in general)!

this project can be found
